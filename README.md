### FOR THE FORMULAIRE
<small>note: Most of layout.tsx is generated by next create app (command to init a nextjs project), which also generated the config files.</small>
```bash
npm run dev
```

### For the website
<small>Open `localhost:3000` to see the webpage

All source code for the formulaire & the page redirected to (/registered) are in `info/app/page.tsx` & `info/app/registered/page.tsx`

ONLY those pages are commented, theres notes about the code at the top of the formulaire/page.tsx. (Usage of ai + things used)</small>
Most of the code is in `info/app/page.tsx`, there isnt much in `info/app/registered/page.tsx`, its the page redirected to after register
