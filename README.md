##  To get Started

To install dependencies (needs npm installed)

```

The Ressources documentaires is in app/ressources/pages.tsx
The main page is in  app/page.tsx

To run the website after installing dependencies 

```bash

```
--------------------------------------------------------
### FOR THE FORMULAIRE
<small>note: because this repo contains all the work from all the classes, the formulaire only consists of `app/formulaire`, `app/registered` and `app/layout.tsx`. Most of layout.tsx is generated by next create app (command to init a nextjs project), which also generated the config files.</small>
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open `localhost:3000/formulaire` to see the webpage
All source code for the formulaire & the page redirected to (/registered) are in `info/app/formulaire/page.tsx` & `info/app/registered.tsx`

--------------------------------------------------------
Added features:
```
- animation on hover (register div) line 116
- error message 
- detection for special character
- detection for minimum 8 characters
- actual redirected page (/registered) with username displayed
- uses html directly in the page to indicate requirments
```
